### Hi, I’m Fraser

I've been a photographer for over 10 years, focusing primarily on event photography. My journey began from taking photographs at events at school and then university. Throughout I’ve been experimenting, learning and developing my skills.  

My approach to photography focuses on capturing the moment, finding emotion and structure amongst the chaos. I look to capture documentary style photography but I equally enjoy using various techniques to create a particular look whether that be for an experiemental or a highly curated look.
I like to work with clients to create images that suit their tastes and the nature of their brand or the event they’re running.  

When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me at the beach, sailing or swimming; exploring new cities, or cooking elaborate meals.
